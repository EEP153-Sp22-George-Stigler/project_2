Topic: Comparing the cost of a pescatarian diet in Anchorage, Alaska and Irvine, California

Goals: Elucidate the differences in the cost of living in a place like Anchorage, AK that is known to have high food prices due to the amount of importing the state does relative to a state like California whose food prices are reflective of the large amount of agricultural production in the state.
